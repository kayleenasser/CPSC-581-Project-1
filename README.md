# Kaylee's Love Guesser
## A Tale of Two Buttons - CPSC 581
### Kaylee Nasser, Caitlin McConnery, and Abdullah Ishtiaq

"Kaylee's Love Guesser" is a web application where users can guess how much Kaylee likes a particular item by inflating or deflating a heart balloon. This was the result of our attempt to fulfill an assignment task of creating an application made up of only two buttons that represented one of our groupmates. 
The two buttons are as follows:
1. A button to toggle the tool the user wields
2. The interactable heart balloon

The user interacts with the balloon by clicking on it to inflate or deflate it, and then checks their response by toggling the tool button. The application provides visual feedback for correct or wrong guesses. The goal is to make a fun guessing game centered around Kaylee's likes and dislikes.
